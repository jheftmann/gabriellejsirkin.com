## CMS

Content is managed via [Sveltia CMS](https://github.com/sveltia/sveltia-cms) at `/admin/`.

**CMS URL:** https://gabriellesirkin.github.io/gabriellejsirkin.com/admin/

Login with GitHub. The CMS lets you edit:
- **Projects** — all metadata fields
- **Home** — hero text
- **Settings** — site title, description, nav links

Changes made in the CMS are committed directly to the `main` branch on GitHub, which triggers an automatic rebuild of the HTML files.

**Auth worker:** `https://sveltia-cms-auth.orsa.workers.dev` (Cloudflare Worker — handles GitHub OAuth)

> Note: Images cannot yet be uploaded via the CMS. Add images by dropping them into the project folder in `content/projects/{slug}/` and pushing to GitHub.

---

## Previewing locally

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed (download and run the installer — you only need to do this once).

**First time only** — install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

**Every time you want to preview:**

```
npm start
```

This opens the site at **http://localhost:3000** and automatically reloads the browser whenever you save a file in `src/` or `content/`.

---

## Adding or editing a project

Every project lives in its own folder inside `content/projects/`. Each folder contains an `index.md` file that holds all the project's metadata.

```
content/projects/
  all-in-the-family/
    index.md        ← all metadata for this project
    hero.jpg
    detail-1.jpg
```

### The index.md format

## Deploying

Push your changes to the `main` branch on GitHub. The site updates automatically within a minute or two.

```
git add .
git commit -m "describe what you changed"
git push
```

---

## Editing global settings

Site-wide values live in `content/settings.md` (or edit via the CMS under Settings → Global):

```
---
site_title: Gabrielle J. Sirkin
site_description: Visual Director and photographer based in Los Angeles.
site_url: https://gabriellesirkin.github.io/gabriellejsirkin.com
footer_year: 2026
nav:
  - Work|index.html
  - Travel Creative Services|travel.html
  - About|about.html
---
```

---

## Editing homepage text

The homepage hero text is in `content/pages/home.md` (or edit via the CMS under Pages → Home).

---

## Sharecard (link preview image)

When the site is shared on social media it uses `sharecard.jpg` in the root folder. Save a **1200 × 630 px** JPG there to enable it.

---

## Favicon

The favicon (`favicon.svg`) is a temporary placeholder. Replace it with a proper version when ready.
